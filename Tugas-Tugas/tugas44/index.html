                Cormorant is an original design for an extravagant <br />display
                serif typeface inspired by the Garamond <br />heritage,
                hand-drawn and produced by Catharsis <br />Fonts. While
                traditional Garamond cuts make for <br />exquisite reading at
                book sizes, they appear clumpy <br />and inelegant at larger
                sizes. The design goal of <br />Cormorant was to distill the
                æsthetic essence of <br />Garamond, unfetter it from the
                limitations of metal <br />printing, and allow it to bloom into
                its natural refined <br />form at high definition
